Installation
============

Coin2086 is available on PyPI, you may install it with ``pip``. Since working
with coin2086 is much more convenient in Jupyter noteboooks, I also recommend
installing Jupyter Lab.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install coin2086
    pip install jupyterlab
    jupyter lab .

Alternatively, you may launch a Binder notebook with coin2086 installed, directly
in your web browser, without any local installation.

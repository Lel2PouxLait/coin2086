What is coin2086 ?
------------------

The purpose of coin2086 is to help French tax residents to fill their
crypto-currency tax returns (`Formulaire n째2086 <https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/formulaire/2086/declaration-des-plus-ou-moins-values-de-cessions-dactifs-numeriques>`_).

The French tax law,
(`CGI art. 150 VH bis <https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000038612228/2019-05-24>`_) requires tax residents to report their profit and losses (PnL) arising from
each of their crypto-currency sale. Each sale should be reported on `Formulaire n째2086 <https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/formulaire/2086/declaration-des-plus-ou-moins-values-de-cessions-dactifs-numeriques>`_,
or in the web version of this form.

The formula to compute your profit and losses, detailed on `Formulaire n째2086 <https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/formulaire/2086/declaration-des-plus-ou-moins-values-de-cessions-dactifs-numeriques>`_, requires you to valuate your whole crypto-currency portfolio every time you sell, and keep track of the amount of initial investment capital that was sold. This accounting is tedious to do by hand.

Coin2086 does all of that automatically for you. It takes your trades as input, valuates your cryptocurrency portfolio, computes your taxable profit and outputs the exact information you need to fill on Formulaire n째2086.

See :ref:`Installation` and :ref:`Basic usage` to get started.

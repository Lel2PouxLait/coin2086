:orphan:

A dictionary representing your portfolio of
crypto-currencies as it was before the first trade in the ``trades``
DataFrame (see ``trades`` argument). The keys of the ``initial_portfolio``
dictionary are the crypto-currencies, and the values are the
quantities. For example::

    {
        'BTC': 2,
        'ETH': 50,
        'LTC': 100
    }
